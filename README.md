# DiceBot
D&D Dice rolling bot for discord written in python.

## Requirements
This bot uses the [discord.py API wrapper](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), you'll need to set that up for this bot to work.
You'll also need an account for the bot.


## Usage
Add your credentials in `options.py`

Start the bot using `python dbot.py`

Roll dice using `.r 2d20`

If you give the bot permissions to manage messages on your server it will delete and previous rolls from the same user to avoid cluttering up chat.

### Extra bits
Thanks to Rapptz for the discord.py wrapper.

If you want any customization done to this bot for your own use feel free to join my [testing server](https://discord.gg/0n4QSS0mmQNtD5Ve) and message me
